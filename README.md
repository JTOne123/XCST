[XCST][1] â€” eXtensible C-Sharp Templates
========================================
XCST is a language for transforming objects into XML documents. It is based on a subset of XSLT (no `apply-templates`) but using C# as expression language and data model, instead of XPath.

See the [project home][1] for more information.
